# Pharmaceutical_Analysis_matplotlib


Analyzing data with Pandas, and Matplotlib for a pharmaceutical company

For better visualization it is important to start with a clean file and being
very specific in data pulled helps simplify the charting portion.

Structuring DataFrames to have right x-axis and y-axis to build scatter plots.

Utilized groupby to sort through data in order to create Bar & Pie Charts.

Used .loc used to pull specific drug used in Drug Regimen used to treat
each mouse.

Correlation and Regression to group mouse by drug regimen, weight
and Tumor volume.

What was most interesting to see was how a few Drug Regimens
did worse than the placebo. Once Analyzing the results from the 45 day
drug regimen, it was easy to distinguish between which drugs actually
reduced the tumor size in the mice, and which did not.
